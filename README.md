Cohomology of Bismut flat manifolds

This repository has been created as an appendix to my Ph.D. Thesis.
Here you can find the sage script to compute the Dolbeault, Bott-Chern, and Aeppli cohomologies of the simple Lie group G_2 when equipped with an isotropic left-invariant complex structure.
By running it you will obtain the harmonic representatives of these cohomologies.
We recall that isotropic means that it is Hermitian with respect to the bi-invariant metric coming from the Killing form. 
Moreover, the isotropic left-invariant complex structures on G_2 are just two, and they correspond to p = +/- 1 in the script.
